## 1.0.2 - 2026-09-27 - HTTP header control

### Added

Five new client flags for HTTP tunnels, mirroring ngrok's header options. Each one
also has a config-file equivalent, set per tunnel.

| Flag | Repeatable | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `-host-header <value>` | no | `rewrite` sets the Host header of requests sent to your local server to the local address's hostname, `preserve` (the default) leaves it untouched, or pass an explicit hostname to force. The original Host is reported to your server as `X-Forwarded-Host`. |
| `-request-header-add <key:value>` | yes | Appends a header to the request sent to your local server. If the key is already present it is appended again, except `host`, which is overridden. |
| `-request-header-remove <key>` | yes | Removes every request header with that name (case-insensitive). |
| `-response-header-add <key:value>` | yes | Appends a header to the response sent back to the public client. |
| `-response-header-remove <key>` | yes | Removes every response header with that name (case-insensitive). |

Example: expose a local Ollama server that only answers requests whose Host is
`localhost`, and hide the identifying `Server` header:

    ngrok -host-header=rewrite -response-header-remove=Server 11434

The same tunnel in a config file:

```yaml
tunnels:
  ollama:
    proto:
      http: 127.0.0.1:11434
    host_header: rewrite
    request_header:
      add: ["X-Custom: value"]
      remove: ["X-Secret"]
    response_header:
      add: ["X-Served-By: ngrok"]
      remove: ["Server"]
```

### Configuration errors

Bad header configuration fails at startup rather than on the wire, naming the
tunnel and the offending entry:

- `host_header` must be `rewrite`, `preserve`, or a hostname with no spaces, no
  `/` and no CR/LF.
- Add entries must be `key:value` with a non-empty key; keys must be valid HTTP
  header names (RFC 7230 tokens).
- `user-agent` may not be added or removed.
- Any CR or LF in a value is rejected (header-injection guard).

### Behavior changes to be aware of

- `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` are now injected on every HTTP/HTTPS
  tunnel, even when no header flags are set. `X-Forwarded-For` replaces any value
  the public client sent, so upstreams can trust it for the real client IP.
- `Location` response headers are **not** rewritten when the Host is rewritten
  (ngrok does rewrite them). Deferred to a follow-up release.
- TCP tunnels are unaffected: header settings are validated but never applied.
- Response header actions apply to the final response only; interim 1xx
  responses (e.g. `100 Continue`, `101 Switching Protocols`) pass through
  unchanged.
- Known limitation: if a keep-alive connection pipelines a `HEAD` followed by
  a body-bearing request before the first response returns, the HEAD's
  response body may be mis-framed; the connection then fails open to raw
  passthrough (no data loss, rewriting stops).
